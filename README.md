Scrap.py is designed to scrap data from http://books.toscrape.com/

The spimplest way to test it is to:
_ Clone the repository on your own computer.
_ Create a new virtual environment in the same folder as scrap.py
_ Activate the virtual environment
_ Install the dependencies via the requirement.txt file

Note: for now you need to create data/csv and data/img folders in the same folder as scrap.py.
